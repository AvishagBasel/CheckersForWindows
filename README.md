# CheckersForWindows

## Objective
* Using Classes for implementing Object Oriented Programing concepts
* Using Constructors, Enums, Properties, Access modifiers, Modifiers
* Working with Arrays / Collections / Data Structures
* Use of the String Class
* Referencing External DII (Assembly)

## The Exercise
You must implement the game American Checkers for Console.

## Architecture and Software Engineering:
* You must use Object Oriented architecture!
* You must demonstrate correct use of C# and .Net capabilities 
* You must apply correct segregation between the Classes who manage the logics and data of the game and the Classes who are responsible for the UI and User Interactions.
In other words: Seperation between the implementation of the User Interface (UI) and the implementation of the system’s logic.
You must keep in mind that these implementations will serve you when you will want to develop the game for “Windows”, and the aspiration is to have as many reusable parts (unchanged) as possible.
